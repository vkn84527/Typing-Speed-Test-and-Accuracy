# Typing-Speed-Test-and-Accuracy

In this Python project, I am  going to build an exciting project through
which you can check and even improve your typing speed. For a graphical user interface, 
we are going to use the pygame library which is used for working with graphics. 
We will draw the images and text to be displayed on the screen.
